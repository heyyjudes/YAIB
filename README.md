[//]: # (TODO: add coverage once we have some tests )

Yet another ICU benchmark (YAIB) provides a framework for doing clinical machine learning experiments on (ICU) EHR data.
We support the following datasets out of the box:

| Dataset                 | [MIMIC-III](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/) / [IV](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/) | [eICU-CRD](https://physionet.org/content/eicu-crd/) | [HiRID](https://physionet.org/content/hirid/1.1.1/) | [AUMCdb](https://doi.org/10.17026/dans-22u-f8vd) |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Admissions              | 40k / 50k                                                                                           | 200k                                                | 33k                                                 | 23k                                              |
| Frequency (time-series) | 1 hour                                                                                              | 5 minutes                                           | 2 / 5 minutes                                       | up to 1 minute                                   |
| Origin                  | USA                                                                                                 | USA                                                 | Switzerland                                         | Netherlands                                      |

The benchmark is designed for operating on preprocessed parquet files. We refer to the PyICU (in development)
or [ricu package](https://github.com/eth-mds/ricu) for generating these parquet files for particular cohorts and endpoints.

We provide several common tasks for clinical prediction:

| No  | Task Theme                | Temporality        | Type                                | 
|-----|---------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | ICU Mortality             | Hourly (after 24H) | Sequential Classification           |
| 2   | Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) | Hourly (within 6H) | Sequence to Sequence Classification |
| 3   | Sepsis                    | Hourly (within 6H) | Sequence to Sequence Classification |

[//]: # (| 4   | Circulatory Failure       | 5 Minutes          | Sequence to Sequence Classification |)

[//]: # (| 5   | Length of Stay &#40;LoS&#41;      | Hourly             | Sequence to Sequence Regression     | )

# Installation

YAIB currently requires an installation of Conda. Below you will find the three CLI commands to install YAIB.
The

The first command will install an environment based on Python 3.10 (currently).

```
conda env update -f <environment.yml|environment_mps.yml>
```

> Use `environment.yml` on x86 hardware and `environment_mps.yml` on Macs with Metal Performance Shaders.

We then activate the environment and install a package called `icu-benchmarks`, after which YAIB should be operational.

```
conda activate yaib
pip install -e .
```

# Usage

## Getting the Datasets

HiRID, eICU, and MIMIC IV can be accessed through [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/). A guide to this process can be
found [here](https://eicu-crd.mit.edu/gettingstarted/access/).
AUMCdb can be accessed through a separate access [procedure](https://github.com/AmsterdamUMC/AmsterdamUMCdb). We do not have
involvement in the access procedure and can not answer to any requests for data access.

## Data Conversion

Since the datasets were created independently of each other, they do not share the same data structure or data identifiers. In
order to make them interoperable, use the preprocessing utilities
provided by the [ricu package](https://github.com/eth-mds/ricu).
Ricu pre-defines a large number of clinical concepts and how to load them from a given dataset, providing a common interface to
the data, that is used in this
benchmark.

### Extracting cohorts

TODO

# Data

YAIB expects data generated by [pyicu](https://github.com/prockenschaub/pyicu), a
rewritten [ricu](https://github.com/prockenschaub/ricu-package) for Python.

## Demo data

In the folder `demo_data` we provide processed publicly available demo datasets from eICU and MIMIC with the necessary lables
for `Akute Kidney Injury`, `Mortality at 24h` and `Sepsis`.

# Use with CLI Commands

## Preprocess and Train

The following command will run training and evaluation on the MIMIC demo dataset for (Binary) Mortality prediction at 24h with the
LGBMClassifier. Child samples are reduced due to the small amount of training data. We load available cache and, if available, load 
existing cache files.

```
icu-benchmarks train \
    -d demo_data/mortality24/mimic_demo \
    -n mimic_demo \
    -t BinaryClassification \
    -tn Mortality24 \
    -m LGBMClassifier \
    -hp LGBMClassifier.min_child_samples=10 \
    -gc \
    -lc \
    -s 2222 \
    -l ../yaib_logs/ \
    --tune
```

> For a list of available flags, run `icu-benchmarks train -h`.

> Run with `PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1` on Macs with Metal Performance Shaders.

> For Windows based systems, the next line character (\\)  needs to be replaced by (^) (Command Prompt) or (`) (Powershell)
> respectively.

### Hyperparameter Tuning

To understand how a parameter can be automatically tuned via bayesian optimization, let's look at the following example
configuration:

```
...
# Optimizer params
optimizer/hyperparameter.class_to_tune = @Adam
optimizer/hyperparameter.weight_decay = 1e-6
optimizer/hyperparameter.lr = (1e-5, 3e-4)

# Encoder params
model/hyperparameter.class_to_tune = @LSTMNet
model/hyperparameter.input_dim = %EMB
model/hyperparameter.num_classes = %NUM_CLASSES
model/hyperparameter.hidden_dim = (32, 256)
model/hyperparameter.layer_dim = (1, 3)

tune_hyperparameters.scopes = ["model", "optimizer"]  # defines the scopes that the random search runs in
tune_hyperparameters.n_initial_points = 5  # defines random points to initilaize gaussian process
tune_hyperparameters.n_calls = 30  # numbe rof iterations to find best set of hyperparameters
tune_hyperparameters.folds_to_tune_on = 2  # number of folds to use to evaluate set of hyperparameters
```

In this example, we have the two scopes `model` and `optimizer`, the scopes take care of adding the parameters only to the
pertinent classes.
For each scope a `class_to_tune` needs to be set to the class it represents, in this case `LSTMNet` and `Adam`
respectively.
We can add whichever parameter we want to the classes following this syntax:

```
tune_hyperparameters.scopes = ["<scope>", ...]
<scope>/hyperparameter.class_to_tune = @<SomeClass>
<scope>/hyperparameter.<param> = ['list', 'of', 'possible', 'values']
```

If we run `experiments` and want to overwrite the model configuration, this can be done easily:

```
include "configs/tasks/Mortality_At24Hours.gin"
include "configs/models/LSTM.gin"

optimizer/hyperparameter.lr = 1e-4

model/hyperparameter.hidden_dim = [100, 200]
```

This configuration for example overwrites the `lr` parameter of `Adam` with a concrete value,
while it only specifies a different search space for `hidden_dim` of `LSTMNet` to run the random search on.

The same holds true for the command line. Setting the following flag would achieve the same result (make sure to only have
spaces between parameters):

```
-hp optimizer/hyperparameter.lr=1e-4 model/hyperparameter.hidden_dim='[100,200]'
```

There is an implicit hierarchy, independent of where the parameters are added (`model.gin`, `experiment.gin` or CLI `-hp`):

```
LSTM.hidden_dim = 8                         # always takes precedence
model/hyperparameter.hidden_dim = 6         # second most important
model/hyperparameter.hidden_dim = (4, 6)    # only evaluated if the others aren't found in gin configs and CLI
```

The hierarchy CLI `-hp` > `experiment.gin` > `model.gin` is only important for bindings on the same "level" from above.

## Evaluate

It is possible to evaluate a model trained on another dataset. In this case, the source dataset is the demo data from MIMIC and
the target is the eICU demo:

```
icu-benchmarks evaluate \
    -d demo_data/mortality24/eicu_demo \
    -n eicu_demo \
    -t BinaryClassification \
    -tn Mortality24 \
    -m LGBMClassifier \
    -c \
    -s 2222 \
    -l ../yaib_logs \
    -sn mimic \
    --source-dir ../yaib_logs/mimic_demo/Mortality24/LGBMClassifier/2022-12-12T15-24-46/fold_0
```

## Metrics

Several metrics are defined for this benchmark:

- Binary Classification: Because our tasks are all highly imbalanced, we use both ROC and PR Area Under the Curve
  using [sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score.html)
  and [sklearn.metrics.average_precision_score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.average_precision_score.html#sklearn.metrics.average_precision_score)
- Regression : The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is used
  with [sklearn.metrics.mean_absolute_error](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.mean_absolute_error.html)

## Models

We provide several existing machine learning models that are commonly used for multivariate time-series data.
`pytorch` is used for the deep learning models, `lightgbm` for the boosted tree approaches, and `sklearn` for the logistic
regression model and metrics.
The benchmark provides the following built-in models:

- [Logistic Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html?highlight=logistic+regression):
  Standard regression approach.
- [LightGBM](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/file/6449f44a102fde848669bdd9eb6b76fa-Paper.pdf): Efficient gradient
  boosting trees.
- [Long Short-term Memory (LSTM)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/818041): The most commonly used type of Recurrent Neural
  Networks for long sequences.
- [Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1078) : A extension to LSTM which showed improvement over them in the
  context of polyphonic music modeling and speech signal modeling ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3555)).
- [Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01271 ): 1D convolution approach to sequence data. By
  using dilated convolution to extend the receptive field of the network it has shown great performance on long-term
  dependencies.
- [Transformers](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf): The most common Attention
  based approach.
